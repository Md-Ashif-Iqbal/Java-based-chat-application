This project involved creating a server capable of managing multiple client connections simultaneously, facilitating real-time communication between users. The server listens for incoming client connections and, upon acceptance, assigns each client to a dedicated thread, ensuring concurrent handling of multiple clients. Clients establish connections to the server using sockets, enabling bidirectional communication.
